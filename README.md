# Machine Learning Model for early detection of sepsis from clinical data

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death.
Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality.The purpose of the machine learning model is to detect the onset of sepsis in early stage.
